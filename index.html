                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                            <p>
                                My name is Shelby Gallegos and I’m an aspiring software developer. I was born and raised in Littlerock California and when I’m not programming or working on my latest projects for my portfolio I am either working out in the gym, taking my dog bugs on a walk, or checking out new music to add to my spotify playlist.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Education</h3>
                            <p>
                                The degree I have earned is an Associates of Science in Computer Science from Antelope Valley College in Lancaster California with a overall GPA of 3.9. Currently I am attending CSUN in pursuit of my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science with a GPA of 3.9. However my education does not stop there as I am always trying to learn more about my field and gain experience with new tools.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Programming</h3>
                            <p>
                                In terms of programming, my langueages that I'm most fluent in are (in order) Java, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, C, Racket, and Prolog but I'm constantly learning more and growing my skill set. I am well versed in data strucutres and algorithms as well as how many are applied to solve real programming problems that we experience today. 
                            </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                            <p>
                                Computer Science being a versatile degree, my options for employment are quite wide but the areas that I am most passionate about are backend application development for either web or desktop applications. However, once I begin working in the field, I would like to obtain a masters degree so I could teach at a college level to pass on knowledge just as some of the best professors that I have learned from have done.
